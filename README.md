SDL+OpenGL Sandbox
==================

The *SDLOpenGlSandbox* is a basic C++ template program that contains an initialization of [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) in a [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) context and a rotating triangle as a proof the program is running.

There's no glittering things around it and compilation is rather basic. You're supposed to have everything installed and accessible.

SCons is used to build the program. Just type `scons`.
